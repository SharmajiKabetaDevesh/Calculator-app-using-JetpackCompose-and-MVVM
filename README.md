This Calculator app is just a simple run for e to experience what is MVVM model (Model View View Model) .
I think it was boring and at times it sucks as an developer .
But dividing everything and putting logic in different files/modules helps in the long run,because you have names for every short
thing . Just hop to that file and repair it.

View model helps to keep data intact on the UI even when the device rotates ,such is the power of segregation .
